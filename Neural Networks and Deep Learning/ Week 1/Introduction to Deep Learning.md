1. Which of the following are some aspects in which AI has transformed business?
   - Web searching and advertisement
2. Which of the following are reasons that didn't allow Deep Learning to be developed during the '80s?
   - Limited computational power
   - Interesting applications such as image recognition require large amounts ofdaa that were not available
3. Recall the diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the stages shown in the diagram was improved with the use of a better GPU/CPU?

   - Experiments finish faster, producing better ideas through increased iteration tempo.
   - Some algorithms are specifically designed to run experiments faster.
4. When building a neural network to predict housing price from features like size, the number of bedrooms, zip code, and wealth, it is necessary to come up with other features in between input and output like family size and school quality. True/False?
   - False
5. Which of the following depicts a Sigmoid activation function?

   - Fig 2 [Added]
6. Features of animals, such as weight, height, and color, are used for classification between cats, dogs, or others. This is an example of "structured" data, because they are represented as arrays in a computer. True/False?
   - True. Yes. The data can be represented by columns of data. This is an example of structured data unlike images of the animal.
7. Which of the following are examples of structured data? Choose all that apply.
   - A dataset of weight, height, age, the sugar lvl in the blood, and arterial pressure.
   - A dataset with zip code, income, and name of a person.
8. Why can an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) be used to create English captions to French movies? Choose all that apply.
    - The RNN is applicable since the input and output of the problem are sequences.
    - It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
9. Suppose the information given in the diagram is accurate. We can deduce that when using large training sets, for a model to keep improving as the amount of data for training grows, the size of the neural network must grow. True/False?\

    - True
10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
    - Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.
    - Increasing the size of neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm's performance, and it may help significantly.
